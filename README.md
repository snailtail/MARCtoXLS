# MARCtoXLS
A repo for a small project that converts MARC21 lists to Excel format

Uses the great work from (https://github.com/afrozenpeach/CSharp_MARC) as a base, and then added (within .\Extensions\Toreboda.cs) the SwiftExcel stuff, and some rules for my local Library's needs.

An example list `shelf.iso2709` in MARC21 format is included in the subfolder Testfiles.
